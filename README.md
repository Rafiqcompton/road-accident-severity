Introduction
Traffic accidents pose significant challenges to public safety. Understanding the factors that contribute to accident severity can play a crucial role in mitigating risks and enhancing safety protocols.
This project develops a linear regression model to analyze various factors such as weather conditions, time of day, road type, and driver demographics

Dataset Information
The dataset used in this analysis includes the following key variables:

Dependent Variable (Y): Accident Severity (Categorical/Ordinal)
Independent Variables (X):
Weather Conditions (e.g., Sunny, Rainy)
Time of Day (e.g., Morning, Evening)
Road Type (e.g., Urban, Rural)
Vehicle Type (e.g., Car, Truck)
Driver Age (Numerical)
Model Development
The model is developed using Python, leveraging libraries such as:

pandas for data manipulation
scikit-learn for linear regression modeling
joblib for saving and loading the model

Code Snippet

python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import joblib

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('accident_data.csv')

# Define features and target variable
X = data[['Weather', 'Time', 'Road', 'VehicleType', 'DriverAge']]
Y = data['AccidentSeverity']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and fit the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Save the model for future predictions
joblib.dump(model, 'accident_severity_model.pkl')


Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed, along with the following libraries:

bash

pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
Usage Instructions
Load your trained model:

python
model = joblib.load('accident_severity_model.pkl')
Prepare your independent variables as needed by the model:
python

input_data = [[...]]  # Replace with actual feature values
severity_prediction = model.predict(input_data)
print(severity_prediction)

Example
if you want to predict accident severity for:

Weather: Rainy
Time: Night
Road Type: Urban
Vehicle Type: Car
Driver Age: 30
Convert the input data appropriately and run it through the model to get a prediction

Benefits
This predictive model can help in:

Identifying high-risk factors that contribute to severe accidents
Informing road safety initiatives and traffic legislation
Allocating resources effectively for accident prevention
